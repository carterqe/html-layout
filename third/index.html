        <p class= "words">I was only like 8. I was terrified of herobrine and was paranoid. I had made this really cool Treehouse and I lived there. The first weird thing that happened was that I swore that I had had certain items that had been disappearing. Here comes the creepy part: I continued to play the game and I was out exploring in the same world. I coincedently looked up in the sky and there was a floating square coal thing in the sky. It scared the ğŸ˜¶ğŸ˜¶ğŸ˜¶ğŸ˜¶ out of me and I deleted the world and that only made me MORE paranoid
